In classical (frequentist) `A/B` testing, we use `p-values` to measure the significance of the experimental feature (being exposed to an ad in our case) over the `null hypothesis` (the hypothesis that there is no difference in brand awareness between the exposed and control groups in the current case). How are `p-values` computed? What information do `p-values` provide? What are the `type-I` and t`ype-II` errors you may have in the analysis?
